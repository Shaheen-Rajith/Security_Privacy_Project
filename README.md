# Group 1 Security and Privacy Project

 Hey all, this is the Github Repo for our Security and Privacy Group Project, so far there isnt much here. the env folder has the yml and txt file needed to created a new "SECPRI" conda env with some needed modules and the trial.py file is just a basic sample hello world webpage to check if the flask module was working and is generating web pages which it is. I need to now make the actual web page for the e-commerce site.

All the code was typed on my Dell XPS Laptop running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. so you run something and random errors appear due to OS or computer differences. I have no idea how to fix them.
